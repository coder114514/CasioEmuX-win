This is a **modified** version of the Casio emulator developed by [qiufuyu](https://github.com/qiufuyu123/CasioEmuX) and contains a nX/U8 disassembler written in lua and one written in cpp (their output formats are different).

Files are modified so that they can work on windows.

Note that ROMs are **not** included in the `models` folder (for copyright reasons), you have to obtain one from somewhere else or dump it from a real calculator or emulator. (note that models labeled with `_emu` are for ROMs dumped from official emulators)
